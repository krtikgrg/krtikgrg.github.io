			<h1>What my friends say about me!!</h1>
			<p id="jtv">	I am selectively altruistic, I have always tried to help some to the fullest 
				and ignored a few completely. An aspiring pantomath, I have tried to learn a 
				lot and have learnt though. I have quiet an outgoing personality and and 
				at some ocassions a flirto type. Overall a chill, hardworking, nice personality.

			<h1 id="me">What I think about me...</h1>
			<p id="mv">
				I personally think myself a very complicated personality. I have certain 
				abilities which make me unique like my willingness to devote myself to my work 
				completely and take it as close as to perfection in available time. I always
				welcome new ideas of people and always try learn something from everyone. But 
				the major flaw in my personality is my introvertness, it is one of those things
				which make me to fall certain times on my knees. Well, in a nutshell I just want to
				say that i have a personality that no one has and it is still developing...

				<h1> Some words of my parents</h1>
				<p id="fv">
					He is such a tough guy that if he has determined to do something then
					nobody can stop him from doing so. Not even us. He remembers words of 
					everyone and just keep them inside his mind without even realizing the 
					person standing in front of him that he has said something that pinched
					him. And he then tries to do each and every method by which he can make
					the other person to take his words back no matter whatever it takes...
